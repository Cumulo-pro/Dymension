## SYNC STATUS 

*cometbft_consensus_fast_syncing* 

Fast Synchronisation Metric: A metric that indicates whether a node in the Dymension consensus system is performing fast synchronisation. When this metric has a value of 1, it means that the node is performing fast synchronisation. Conversely, a value of 0 indicates that the node is not currently performing fast synchronisation. Fast synchronisation is a process in which a node can quickly acquire a copy of the blockchain by downloading compressed states and blocks from full nodes in the network, which speeds up the process of catching up with the network. 

Value: Either NO SYNC (not block syncing) or SYNC (syncing)

## State Syncing 

*cometbft_consensus_state_syncing*

Dymension State Synchronisation Metric: A metric that indicates whether a node in the Dymension consensus system is performing state synchronisation. When this metric has a value of 1, it means that the node is performing state synchronisation. Conversely, a value of 0 indicates that the node is not currently performing state synchronisation. State synchronisation is a process in which a node updates its internal state to reflect the current state of the blockchain, which may include verification of smart contracts, pending transactions, among other things. 

Value: indicates whether a node is synchronising its state, FALSE is not currently performing state synchronisation, TRUE is performing state synchronisation.

## Node Last Signed Height  

*cometbft_consensus_validator_last_signed_height*  

Indicates the most recent blockchain height at which a specific validator has signed a block in the Dymension consensus system. The numerical value represents this height. This metric is useful for monitoring the activity and status of validators on the network, as the signed height reflects the progress of consensus and validator participation in block production.  

Value: numeric value indicating the last height signed by the validator or No validator in case the node is not a validator.

## Connected peers & P2P peers  

*cometbft_p2p_peers*

## Block time  

**celestia_consensus_block_time_seconds**  

Average time between the creation of consecutive blocks in the Celestia consensus system, expressed in seconds. This metric is critical for assessing the efficiency and health of the network, as a lower block time may indicate a faster and more responsive network, while a higher block time may indicate possible congestion problems or slowness in the consensus process.

Value: average block time in seconds in the Celestia consensus system

## Missing Validators Power  

**cometbft_consensus_missing_validators_power** 

Total power of missing validators in the Dymension consensus system. Missing validators refer to those who are not active or are not participating in the consensus process at a given time. This metric can provide information about the health and integrity of the network, as a significant missing validator power could indicate problems with the participation or availability of validator nodes in the network. 

Value: numeric value representing the total power of the missing validators in the Dymension consensus system. A low or zero value is desirable, as it suggests active and healthy participation of validators in the consensus process.

## Nº Validators missing blocks 

**celestia_consensus_missing_validators** 

Validator signatures are essential to validate and ensure the integrity of blocks on the blockchain. This metric can provide information on how many validators are not actively participating in the consensus process at any given time. A low or zero value is desirable, as it suggests high participation and cooperation of validators in the network. 

Value: number of validators who did not sign in the Celestia consensus system

![image](https://github.com/Cumulo-pro/Celestia-monitoring/assets/2853158/41b993fc-a560-4c6c-a426-c35be74d82f7)

##  Total bonded tokens  

**celestia_consensus_validators_power**  

A measure indicating the total combined power of all active validators in the Celestia consensus system. The power of validators refers to their collective influence on the consensus process and can be determined by several factors, such as the amount of participation in the network, the reputation of the validator and other criteria set by the consensus protocol. This metric provides an overview of the accumulated power of validators in the network at a given time, which can be useful for assessing the security and robustness of the consensus system.

Value: number representing the total power of all validators in the Celestia consensus system.

##  Interval between Consensus Blocks  

**celestia_consensus_block_interval_seconds_bucket**

This metric records the time that elapses between the production of consecutive blocks in the Celestia system, measured in seconds. It helps to understand how often new blocks are being generated in the network. For example, if there is a bucket for intervals of up to 10 seconds, it means that most blocks are being produced in that time period or less. This can be useful for assessing the efficiency and speed of the block generation process in the network.

Value: Histogram recording the time between consecutive blocks in seconds in the Celestia system.

##  Number of block parts received  

**celestia_consensus_block_gossip_parts_received** 

This metric counts the number of block parts received by a node in the Celestia system through gossip messages. Each share may or may not be relevant to the block that the node is currently collecting, and this information is recorded with the matches_current tag. This can be useful to monitor the amount of data the node is receiving during the block gathering process and to understand whether the received parties are relevant to the current block.

Value: number of block parts received by the node

##  Duplicate Transactions in Mempool  

**celestia_mempool_already_seen_txs** 

Number of transactions that have entered the mempool in the Celestia system, but were already present in the mempool at the time.
